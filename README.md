# ðŸŽ® RustyBoy

RustyBoy is a Game Boy emulator written in Rust. The project aims to provide a lightweight, efficient, 
and accurate emulator to help understand Game Boy hardware and deliver a smooth gaming experience.

## Features
- Emulates Game Boy CPU (LR35902) instructions

- Supports ROM loading and execution

- Implements memory management and registers

- Basic graphics rendering pipeline

- Handles input controls

- Cycle-accurate timing for better compatibility

- Modular and extensible codebase written in safe Rust

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Rust toolchain (stable recommended): https://rustup.rs/

Cargo package manager (comes with Rust)

### Build and Run
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rustyboy.git
--to complete--
```

Usage
After running the emulator with a ROM file, you should be able to test the ROM using the keyboard or your configured input device.
